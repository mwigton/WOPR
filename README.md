# WOPR
Emulation of main characters screen when connected to WOPR in the movie "War Games". 
Written to run on an IBM PC XT (DOS 2.0). Written mostly in C with a little C++(cout used) with OpenWacom IDE, 16bit DOS compilation.
This project was done for the Cold War Museum, and is on display on the second floor. http://www.coldwar.org/

The ASCII Maps used were used from Franklin Wei's emulator with mods to support the 80 column screen limit and the blinking bombs.
