# WOPR
Emulation of main characters screen when connected to WOPR in the movie "War Games".
Running on an IBM PC XT (DOS 2.0). C with OpenWacom 16bit compilation.
This project was done for the Cold War Museum in Warrenton, VA. it is on display on the second floor. http://www.coldwar.org/

The ASCII Maps used were used from Franklin Wei's emulator with mods to support the 80 column screen limit and the blinking bombs.
